### Developing

The site is just a regular SvelteKit project, with ssr disabled.

For development, start the vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*Note: Due to migration from Rollup, HMR breaks the site. You have to do a full reload if you modify any components or TS files.*

For production, build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Contributing

You can fork this repo and modify it however I wont really be accepting pull requests due to the nature of the website being based on "taste" and a showcase of my work.

If you decide to use this site for your own commercial work, replace my personal logos with yours.

Please don't use my personal logos as yours.
